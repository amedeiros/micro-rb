# MicroRb

MicroRb allows you to develop micro services for the [micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) framework.
MicroRb uses the [sidecar](https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/car) that comes with micro. If you want to write services in Go see [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) or in java see [ja-micro](https://github.com/Sixt/ja-micro). 

## Installation

Currently not on rubygems install with bundler and git

```ruby
gem 'micro-rb', github: 'amedeiros/micro-rb'
````

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'micro-rb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install micro-rb

## Status

Currently in development. If I can get some pull requests that would be much appreciated.

## Usage

```ruby
class Myhandler
  include MicroRb::Handler
  handler name: :test

  def sum(request, params)
    { total: params['a'] + params['b'] }
  end
end


server = MicroRb::Servers::Web.new(:test, debug: true)
server.add_handler Myhandler.new
server.start!
```

Configuration has the following defaults for sidecar endpoint.

`Host: "http://127.0.0.1:8081"`

`Registy: "/registry"`


Configuration can be changed.

```ruby
MicroRb::Configuration.configure do |c|
  c.sidecar_host     = 'http://mysite.com:8080'
  c.sidecar_registry = '/awesome_registry'
end
```

Want to run puma? No problem just add puma to your Gemfile and require the rack handler and tell the web server to use puma.
This works with thin etc because we just pass the options along to the rack server. Try it with the sum example!

```ruby
require 'rack/handler/puma'
server = MicroRb::Servers::Web.new(:test, debug: true, server: :puma)
```
